# Java
## What does this repository contain?
This is a beginner-friendly repository which features programs in Java.

## Can I contribute?
Yes! :smile: you can definitely contribute!
The following are some of the things you can do - 
1. If you have a program written in Java that is not in the repository you can open up a PR. You can also open up a PR if you have another way of implementing a concept in the repo.
2. Also, if you can see something wrong (maybe like an error or something), you can open up a PR.
3. Another suggestion is if you can think of a creative way to explain any concept using markdown, you are welcome to contribute!

## How can I contribute?
It is very easy to contribute, you may follow these steps - 
1. Fork this repository
2. Make changes/ add things (if adding a new program please check the program list below to see if the program hasn't been implemented already)
3. Add a comment at the top of your program describing what it does (e.g. "Program to demonstrate abstract classes in Java")
4. If you add a new program, update the list of programs in the readme file
5. Make sure to merge the latest master branch into your feature branch to avoid conflicts
6. Open up a PR. It will be merged after review.
