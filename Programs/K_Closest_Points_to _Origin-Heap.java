/* Minimum Heap Example:

	K Closest Points to Origin 
		- Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
              return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
		  The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
	Example 
		Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
		Output: [[-2,2]]

		Explanation:
			The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
			The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
			Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
			We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
